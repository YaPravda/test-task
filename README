Hi there!
Here are a tiny CSS Framework that contains 2 variants of button styling.
Main idea was: create nice looking buttons without any images, only CSS3.
I have few ideas to make some CSS3 transitions/animations, but i need more time for this stuff.
This code tested on IE6/Opera 11+/FF6+/Safari 5+/ and God knows where else more :)
I think there are can be minor bugs. I need just a little free time for find and fix tham all.
